# aoc2021-rust
My Advent of Code solutions in Rust for the year 2021

I don't have any prior experience with Rust, so please bear with me, if I do something stupid.
Apart from that, feel free to look around and take some inspirations.

### Remarks
For now, I'll not upload my puzzle inputs, you can get them from the official [home page](https://adventofcode.com/2021)
yourself.
